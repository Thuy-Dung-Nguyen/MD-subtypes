# DERIVE PHENOTYPE IN UKB
## EXTRACT DATA UKB
The code in the UKB_variable_extraction.Rmd was used to extract data from UKB mother datasets.
In this file, you can find the variable list which are stored in each dataset mentioned in the section DERIVE MD CASES, CONTROLS, EXCLUSION CRITERIA and DERIVE MD SUBTYPES.
If having access the UKB datasets, you can use these code to extract variable out into child datasets. Then, use those child datasets as input dataset to derive variables.

## DERIVE MD CASES, CONTROLS, EXCLUSION CRITERIA
The code in Derive_MD_case_control.Rmd was used to derive MD cases, control and exclusion criteria. 
Input data are mentioned in the EXTRACT DATA UKB.

## DERIVE MD SUBTYPES
## PIPILINE FOR GWAS, ESTIMATING SNP-HERITABILITY AND GENETIC CORRELATION
After deriving 



```{bash}
